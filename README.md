## CodingIxD - Body data project: Balance


# Project Overview
Balance is a project focused on integrating Fitbit data to visually represent both heart rate and stress levels. Our primary objective is to offer a unique and engaging visualization of this data.

# Features
Daruma Shape Integration: We are incorporating a Daruma shape to display heart rate data. The Daruma's surface will dynamically reflect the user's heart rate, providing an intuitive representation.

LED Lights Integration: Complementing the Daruma, we have integrated LED lights controlled by a ESP32 ­WROOM ­DA. We are exploring the feasibility of individually controlling each LED lamp to represent stress levels. The chosen color range spans from dark blue for calm states to white for high-stress situations.

# Technical Details
Breadbord and jumpers, Microcontroller ESP32, D-MOSFET, LED Strip, Stepper Motor, Resistors 1200 +- 5% and 870 +- 1%

Our prototype is based on a ESP32 ­WROOM ­DA micro controller which concurrently handles the translates of the input data (pulse and perceived stress level) to the LED strip as well as the Stepper Motor which are handeling the illumination and movement of our prototype respectively.

# Conclusion
Our overarching goal is to seamlessly merge health data with an engaging and culturally significant visualization. We are enthusiastic about the potential impact of the Balance project and are committed to continuous refinement.
